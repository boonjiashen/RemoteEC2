Folder for script common to all Remote desktop stuff

In your Mac, run

```
./build-client.sh
```

Run this in RHEL

```
sudo yum -y install git && \
git clone http://github.com/boonjiashen/remoteEc2 && \
cd remoteEc2
```

To run RDP, you just need the hostname "xxx.aws.com", username (typically
ubuntu or ec2-user) and the password that you had set for that user. If the
password hasn't been set, you can set it with `sudo passwd <ubuntu|ec2-user>`

SSH commands

```
ssh -i $RHEL_PEM $RHEL_REMOTE_USER@$RHEL_REMOTE_HOST
ssh -i $AL_PEM $AL_REMOTE_USER@$AL_REMOTE_HOST
ssh -i $UBUNTU_PEM $UBUNTU_REMOTE_USER@$UBUNTU_REMOTE_HOST
```
